# Plant Disease Detection System

A simple web application that helps farmers and gardeners identify plant diseases from leaf images using artificial intelligence. Just upload a photo of a plant leaf, and the system will tell you if the plant is healthy or diseased, along with treatment recommendations.

## What Can This App Do?

- **Identify Plant Diseases**: Upload a leaf photo and get instant results
- **Treatment Advice**: Get practical recommendations on how to treat the disease
- **Batch Analysis**: Check multiple plant images at once (up to 10 images)
- **Track History**: View statistics of all your previous scans
- **Works Offline**: Once set up, works on your local computer without internet

## Supported Plants

The system can identify diseases in these plants:
- **Fruits**: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Grape, Orange, Peach, Raspberry, Strawberry
- **Vegetables**: Tomato, Potato, Pepper, Corn, Squash, Soybean

**Total: 39 different conditions across 14 plant types**

   Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

**6. Open in Browser**
   - Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
   - Go to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - You'll see the Plant Disease Detection page!

### Using the Application

1. **Upload a Photo**
   - Click on the upload area or drag and drop a leaf image
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG (max 16MB)

2. **Analyze**
   - Click the "Analyze Image" button
   - Wait a few seconds for results

3. **View Results**
   - See the plant type and disease (if any)
   - Read treatment recommendations
   - View confidence score

4. **Batch Analysis** (Optional)
   - Click "Batch Upload" tab
   - Select multiple images (up to 10)
   - Analyze all at once

### Stopping the Application

- Go back to the command prompt/terminal
- Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac)
- The server will stop

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem: "Python not found"**
- Solution: Install Python from python.org and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**Problem: "Model file not found"**
- Solution: Make sure files `plant_disease_model.h5` and `plant_disease_classes.npy` are in the project folder

**Problem: "Address already in use"**
- Solution: Close the previous instance or restart your computer

**Problem: "Can't connect to localhost:5000"**
- Solution: Make sure the application is running (check the terminal for "Running on..." message)

**Problem: Low accuracy results**
- Solution: Use clear, well-lit photos of leaves with visible symptoms

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Take Clear Photos**
   - Use good lighting (natural daylight is best)
   - Focus on the leaf showing symptoms
   - Avoid blurry or dark images

2. **Image Guidelines**
   - Single leaf per image works best
   - Show the entire leaf if possible
   - Include visible disease symptoms

3. **Interpreting Results**
   - Confidence above 90% = Very reliable
   - Confidence 70-90% = Fairly reliable
   - Confidence below 70% = Consider retaking the photo

4. **When to Consult an Expert**
   - If results seem incorrect
   - For severe or spreading infections
   - Before applying any chemical treatments

## Project Files

Here's what each file does:

- **app.py** - Main application (runs the web server)
- **plant_disease_model.h5** - AI model that detects diseases
- **plant_disease_classes.npy** - List of diseases the model knows
- **treatment_recommendations.json** - Treatment advice for each disease
- **requirements.txt** - List of software dependencies
- **templates/** - Folder containing the web page design
- **uploads/** - Stores your uploaded images temporarily
- **results/** - Saves analysis results

## Technical Details (For Developers)

**Technology Stack:**

## Advanced: Running with Docker (Optional)

If you prefer using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose down
```

## Important Notes

- **Privacy**: All images are stored locally on your computer
- **Offline Use**: Once set up, no internet required
- **Storage**: Old images can be deleted from `uploads/` folder
- **Accuracy**: This is a tool to assist, not replace professional diagnosis
- **Dataset Folders**: The `archive/` and `PlantVillage/` folders contain training data (~1.7GB) and are excluded from GitHub. The pre-trained model (`plant_disease_model.h5`) is included, so you don't need these folders to run the app.

**These are the only classes and disease types that the model has been trained on. Please note that predictions are limited to the following categories:**
- **Pepper bell**: Bacterial spot, healthy
- **Potato**: Early blight, healthy, Late blight
- **Tomato**: Target Spot, Tomato mosaic virus, Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Bacterial spot, Early blight, healthy, Late blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria leaf spot, Spider mites/Two-spotted spider mite.
  
**Predictions for any category outside this list may not be accurate.**
